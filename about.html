            I really did learn alot about the fundamentals of web, how to
            trouble shoot websites/severs, and website/server deployment. This
            position instilled my self motovation to educate, practice, and

          <p>
            This position requires you to think analytically. I was able to
            apply this techique when I was building my projects. When I was
            coding, There would be times where I would get stuck, and I would
            apply some of these techiques to help resolve errors and/or
            implementation.
